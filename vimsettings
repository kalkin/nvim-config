" Structure of this file:
"       This file defines the vim settings ("set"). They are ordered alphabetically to
"       make it easier to access a specific item. Basically a simple way to sort
"       data :-) These are not all the possible settings, but the ones that I
"       have found relevant to control. (:h options). To see all options use
"       :help option-list
